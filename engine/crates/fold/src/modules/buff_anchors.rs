//! Cast-anchored attribution — the one cast history both the buffs and the crowd-control modules
//! share. Pure apart from the times it is told about; no events, no clock.
//!
//! No bar without a cast line: EQ prints every landing sentence as a broadcast naming no caster
//! (`<mob> has been mesmerized.` alone is four spells in the committed DB), so the cast line is the
//! only thing separating your work from a stranger's.
//!
//! Three anchor forms. `You begin casting <S>.` and `<Name> begins casting <S>.` name the spell —
//! only the first carries a RANK. `You activate Quick Buff.` names a window rather than a spell, so
//! a landing it admits stays a family. The shared `Rc<RefCell<…>>` borrow never nests: the two
//! modules are adjacent in the wiring order and neither reaches into the other during a delivery.
//!
//! A FOURTH FORM, OFF BY DEFAULT (upstream issue #69): a weapon or item proc. EQ prints nothing
//! when an item procs — only the landing — so an Orb of Tishan's Tashania on a mob has no cast line
//! and was dropped on purpose. The evidence that stands in for the cast line comes from outside the
//! sentence: YOU landed a melee hit on that mob inside `PROC_MELEE_WINDOW_MS`, and the spell is a
//! combat effect of an item the inventory dump says you hold. Both halves are required and the
//! gate is a preference (`buffTrust.define`, `procDebuffs`), because a group-mate swinging the same
//! weapon at the same mob prints the identical landing — the residual the user opts into.
