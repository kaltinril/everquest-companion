//! A debuff landed by a weapon or item proc reaches the debuff tracker (upstream issue #69), and
//! only under the opt-in. EQ prints nothing when an item procs, so the landing sentence has no cast
//! line and used to be dropped on purpose. With the switch on, the app's `buffTrust.define` names
//! the combat effects of the items the inventory dump says are held, and a landing on a mob YOU
//! just hit in melee whose sentence names exactly one of them is yours.
//!
//! The reporter's case verbatim: an Orb of Tishan procs Tashania, whose landing sentence is shared
//! by eight enchanter spells in the committed DB, so the family rule alone could never draw it.
