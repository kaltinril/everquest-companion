# bazaar-tab: what was asked for

Every request this feature has taken, newest at the bottom. Read it before changing the branch;
nothing listed here is removed or narrowed without the owner's word (RULES.md, rule 19). The
first rows were gathered on 2026-10-08 from the branch's commits and its BRANCHES.md row, which
record what was built but not always who asked; those say "owner" where the row does.

| Date | Asked by | The ask | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-06 | owner | A tab of what trade chat asked and offered for items: per day, per item, per upgrade tier and per direction (selling, buying, trading). | built |
| 2026-10-06 | owner | Price-over-time charts; a 30-day trend on every row; medians with outliers left out. | built |
| 2026-10-06 | owner | A 7-day average and a predicted price, for asking and for offered. | built |
| 2026-10-06 | owner | The parser reads "paying 4k" after several items, a buy that opens with "paying", and a price before "for" and an item. | built |
| 2026-10-06 | owner | Every column of the list sorts by clicking its header. | built |
| 2026-10-07 | owner | The parser reads acronyms (CoF, RBB, FBSS, SSoY, BCG) where one item fits, glued item links, every tier of a listing, and numbers that count. | built |
| 2026-10-07 | Malkil | A watchlist of items to buy, to sell or only watch, with live alerts. | built, reshaped 2026-10-08 (below) |
| 2026-10-07 | Malkil | A buy alert at or under a price, or at or under a share of the item's 7-day median asking. | built (WTS box: "at or under", "% of 7-day median") |
| 2026-10-07 | Malkil | A sell alert at or over a price; a buyer naming no price still alerts. | built (WTB box: "at or over") |
| 2026-10-07 | owner | Wish-list and Popular filters; item icons on the rows. | built |
| 2026-10-07 | owner | "All tiers as one": one row per item, every tier read as +0. | built |
| 2026-10-07 | owner | Who said what: each day keeps its quotes (one per person per day, the latest 20), shown in the chart hover and an offers list. | built |
| 2026-10-07 | owner | Export the offers as CSV for Excel. | built |
| 2026-10-07 | owner | Hide No Drop / No Trade items. | built |
| 2026-10-07 | owner | A Price at slider (+0 to +10, from +4) for All tiers as one, estimates marked; an item never offered above +0 is not grown. | built |
| 2026-10-07 | owner | A days window; item names hover and open their Loot page; M for millions. | built |
| 2026-10-07 | owner | The picked item's panel folds away to give the list the screen. | built |
| 2026-10-07 | owner | Price floors All, 1P, 100P, 1K, 10K and 100K; platinum written as p. | built |
| 2026-10-08 | Malkil | WTB and WTS must not share one alert toggle. | built (two boxes) |
| 2026-10-08 | Malkil | Watching needs to make sense next to the alert controls (it had no toggle and no explanation). | built (a Watch switch; neither box = only watched) |
| 2026-10-08 | Malkil | The alert should follow the same structure as the Alerts tab. | built (the `bazaarWatch` app signal and a seeded "Bazaar watchlist match" alert) |
| 2026-10-08 | owner | Keep it very simple; an item can be watched for any reason. | built |
| 2026-10-08 | owner | WTS and WTB can both be on for the same item at the same time. | built |
| 2026-10-08 | owner | Use the existing alert framework, so its sound, voice, banner, cooldown and history apply. | built |
| 2026-10-08 | owner | Keep the price thresholds Malkil asked for (they were dropped by mistake in the simplification and restored the same evening). | built |
