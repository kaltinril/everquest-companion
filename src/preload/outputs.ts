// outputs.ts — the slice of the main app's bridge that is about the `/outputfile` REGISTRY: the

// A separate file for FILE MASS, not for scope — planner.ts's arrangement verbatim, and the rule
// it states: `src/preload/index.ts` sits at the measured 400-code-line ceiling and the answer is
// to SPLIT rather than to ratchet. This object is spread into the bridge, so every method below
// is an ordinary member of the one `window.eq` surface and no renderer call site changes.
