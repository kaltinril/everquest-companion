// LEVEL UNLOCKS, assembled — main's half of "what's new at this level"
// (docs/plans/levelup-whats-new.md, wave O2).
//
// NOTHING IS SCRAPED OR FETCHED HERE. Both halves are already committed and already bundled into
// the MAIN process (electron-vite inlines a JSON import — a path-relative read would miss in
// out/main/, the standing gotcha):
//   * spells.json  → the wiki's `classes` bullet list, parsed to (class, level) pairs by
//     shared/spellLevels.ts, plus the four card fields a hover needs.
//   * classes.json → `skillUnlocks` / `discUnlocks` / `disputed`, committed by wave O1.
// The renderer cannot import either (it must not reach into src/main), so this module folds them
// into the one shared wire shape and the panel pulls it once per session.
//
// THE DISPUTE RIDES ON THE ROW. classes.json states its disagreements as prose in `disputed[]`;
// a renderer that had to re-match those strings against rows would be re-deriving knowledge at
// the far end of an IPC. Instead every disputed discipline row carries the wiki's own sentence
// VERBATIM, so the panel's honesty chip is a field read, not an inference (law 1). Twelve rows
// today — BER 2, MNK 10 — the non-Rogue disciplines the central Disciplines page strikes through,
// less the one row a player has since CONFIRMED in game (`CONFIRMED_UNLOCKS`, below).
//
// CACHED FOREVER: both inputs are compile-time constants, so the fold runs once per process.

 * recast. `recastMs` is therefore resolved HERE, once, with `withRecast`'s exact precedence (a
 * page's stated 0 is an answer and blocks the fallback), and `spellMetricsForLevel` divides by the
 * same denominator main did.
 *
 * AND A RAIN'S SNAPSHOT COUNTS ITS WAVES (JOS-449). The wiki's effect line states ONE wave, so the
 * unlock card used to introduce `Frost Storm` at 512 damage while the best-spells table beside it
 * now reads 1,536 — one panel contradicting its neighbour about the same spell. The snapshot is
 * therefore taken at the SINGLE-TARGET hit count (`aeHits(waves, 1, cap)`, which is 3 for a rain

//
//   4 names are BYTE-IDENTICAL PAIRS - Divine Might Effect, Dustdevil, Envenomed Heal, Wind of
//     Tashani. One page scraped twice. Nothing is lost by folding them and nothing can be.
//
//   6 names are ONE SPELL SCRAPED AT TWO DIFFERENT TIMES, where the pages disagree about the
//     numbers. Burst of Flame is the owner's example and the shape is plain once both rows are on
//     screen: 4 mana / 1.5s re-use with `(Autogranted)` beside two of its classes, against 7 mana /
//     2.5s re-use without it. A re-tune, and one of the two pages predates it.
//
//   23 names are GENUINELY TWO SPELLS - Aria of Asceticism is a Bard 45 cure AND a Bard 39 proc
//     buff; Greater Healing is the Cleric line AND a Druid 34 spell with its own message. Folding
//     those would DELETE a spell from the catalog, which is worse than showing two rows.
//
// SO THE CLIENT FILE ADJUDICATES, and nothing else does. It is the same instrument this tree
// already trusts over the wiki for a re-tune (`spellsUsParse.ts` field 14's own note: "two positive
// numbers that differ - a re-tune"), it is the player's own install, and it is CURRENT in a way no
// scrape can promise. Burst of Flame reads mana 4, re-use 1500 in the owner's file - so the
// 7-mana page is the stale one and the fold is a measurement rather than a preference.
//

// client row that matches both rows or neither, and BOTH survive - which is the answer for all 23
// of the genuine pairs, because two different spells cannot both match one client row's mana. The
