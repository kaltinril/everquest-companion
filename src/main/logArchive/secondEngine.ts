// main/logArchive/secondEngine.ts — FOLD ONE LOG WITH A SECOND ENGINE PROCESS (step 5.4).
//
// The app's supervisor is written for one engine: it restarts it, watches its health and hands its
// port to every reader. A refold needs none of that, so this file starts the same binary on its own,
// by the same contract (token as the first line on stdin, the port announced on stdout, closing
// stdin is the shutdown), folds one log, reads every module's snapshot and stops it. Nothing here
// touches the app's engine, its client or its files.
//
// NO STATE FOLDER. The attach carries no `stateDir`, so the second engine reads and writes neither
// the resist ledger nor the message register (the schema's "absent means no persistence").
//
// THE APP'S KNOWLEDGE GOES FIRST, as the app's own client does it (`pushAllDefines`): alert
// definitions, buff trust, respawn watches and the character's combo and roster edits change what a
// fold produces, so they are handed over before the attach.
//
// FIGHTS (step 4.15): asked for, every fight's summary is read after the modules, as the capture
// reads it, so a refresh brings an archive's fight list up to this build too.
//
// RESPAWN HISTORY (step 4.14): asked for, the fold's learned respawn rows of every remembered mob
// are read after the modules, as the capture reads them (`respawnHistory.ts`). This engine is
// thrown away, so there is no watch list to put back.
//
// Electron-free: the caller names the binary and the defines, and hands in the spawn, which is
// `engineHost.ts spawnEngineProcess` (the one module that launches the engine).
