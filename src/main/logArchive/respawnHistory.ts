// main/logArchive/respawnHistory.ts — THE LEARNED GAPS OF EVERY MOB, NOT ONLY THE WATCHED ONES
// (step 4.14).
//
// The respawn fold remembers up to 800 mobs, each with the gaps it measured between deaths, but
// publishes a clock row only for a mob the player watches (`respawn.rs collect`). So a segment's
// `respawn` snapshot holds the gaps of the mobs watched when it was captured, and a mob first
// watched after its log was archived started from nothing.
//
// The history can still be read without changing the engine: the watch list is a define, and the
// fold re-cuts its rows from the history it already holds the moment the list changes (no refold).
// So the capture watches the mobs it knows of in batches, keeps each batch's rows, and puts the
// player's own list back, all inside the capture's before/after pair. The same reader runs against
// the throwaway engine of a refresh, where nothing needs putting back.
//
// WHICH MOBS: every mob in the `kills` snapshot, and every recent respawn candidate. A mob the fold
// saw die but the player never killed and that is no longer recent is not asked for.
//
// WHAT IS KEPT: rows that learned something (a gap, a bound or a sample). A row is at most a few
// hundred bytes; the measured log's 800-mob history is well under a megabyte.
