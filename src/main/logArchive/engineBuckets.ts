// main/logArchive/engineBuckets.ts — RESIST AND LEARNED-MESSAGE HISTORY ACROSS AN ARCHIVE (step 5.2).
//
// The engine keeps `resist-ledger.json` and `message-overlay.json` in the app's data folder, one
// bucket per character. At every attach it empties the attached character's bucket and rebuilds it
// from the log; every other key is seeded and written back unchanged, and every reader pools all
// keys (step 5.1). After an archive the character's bucket shrinks to the fresh log, so this file
// files the archived log's share under a key of its own, `archive:<segment id>`.
//
// WHEN THE BUCKET IS TAKEN, AND WHY NOT AT THE LAUNCH. The copy must hold the archived log's lines
// and nothing else. By the next launch the file no longer does: the engine keeps tailing after the
// move, adds the fresh log's lines to the same bucket and writes it back every minute. Copied then,
// those lines would count twice, once in the copy and once in the next fold of the fresh log. So the
// bucket is READ at the archive, after the capture and before the log is moved, and kept beside the
// segment as `<id>.buckets.json`. It is not written into the engine's files then, because the engine
// rewrites its whole store every minute and drops a key it was not seeded with. The next launch puts
// it in before the engine is told where its files are (`placeArchivedBuckets`), once: a key that is
// already there is left as it is.
//
// THE FILE MUST BE THIS ATTACH'S WRITE. A file written by an earlier attach can still hold an older
// log's lines under this character. `settle` waits, before the capture, for the engine's next write
// of either file, at most 65 s: the engine writes on every 60th beat and the first write of an
// attach always lands, so when neither file changes in that time, a write beat passed with nothing
// new to say and the files already hold this attach's buckets. A second archive of one character in
// one run keeps nothing, because the attach still running holds both logs' lines.
//
// What this misses: what the engine learned after its last write and before the move, under a
// minute. It never counts a line twice.
//
// A RESTORED SEGMENT (step 3.6) is no longer sealed and its lines are back in the live log, so the
// next launch, which the restore itself starts, takes its key out again and deletes its stash.
//
// THE FORMAT IS THE CREATOR'S. Only the two versions below are touched; a file of any other version,
// or one that does not parse, is left alone. Writes are temp + fsync + rename (`writeFileDurable`).
