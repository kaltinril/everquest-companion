// main/logArchive/autoArchive.ts — WITH THE SWITCH ON, THE LOG IS KEPT SMALL WITHOUT THE PLAYER.
//
// Owner, 2026-10-06: once Summarize and archive log is on, the player should never have to come
// back to the card. So the switch is the consent, and this archives the log whenever it passes
// AUTO_ARCHIVE_BYTES. It does the same thing the card's button does (`rotateNow`), so every
// preflight rule still holds: it waits while the engine is still reading the log, and it archives
// at most once per app run.
//
// When: once at launch, as soon as the engine has caught up on the log, then once a day. A month
// of play wrote ~300 MB (owner, 2026-10-06), so anything more often buys nothing. The check is a
// stat of the live log; the folder is read only once the log is over the limit.
