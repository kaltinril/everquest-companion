// factionsEvidence.ts — read the LOG's faction receipts since the dump was written, folded.
//
// The RULES all live in shared/factionLog.ts (pure, tested); this file is the fs dozen lines:
// one read-only capped tail read (feedback/slice.ts's own readTail — reuse, never a second one),
// a timestamp window from the dump's mtime, and the fold. It runs on demand (an IPC ask when the
// Factions tab wants it), never on a timer — the engine owns the live tail, and this is a
// bounded second read of a file main already owns the path to, the feedback slice's exact
// arrangement.
//
// THE WINDOW IS THE TAIL'S LAST 32 MB. A log that has grown further than that since the dump
// leaves the unpinned sums incomplete, and the report SAYS so (`complete: false`) rather than
// presenting a partial sum as a total; cap-pinned factions stay exact regardless (the shared
// module's header carries that argument). 32 MB covers weeks of ordinary play — the measured log
// holds its whole 21k faction lines in well under that.
//
// AN ARCHIVED LOG LEFT ITS LINES IN A LEDGER (log archive step 4.16, `shared/factionLedger.ts`,
// kept byte-identical with the `log-archive` branch that writes them). Once a log is archived the
// live log starts after it, so the lines between the dump and the archive are in the ledgers beside
// it: `<Logs>/companion-archive/<segment>.factions.json`. They are read here, read-only, under the
// ledger's own window rule: only lines older than the live read holds, newest ledger first, so
// nothing is counted twice. With ledgers present the window is complete only when the live read and
// the ledgers together reach back to the dump. With none, nothing changes. The ledgers are read
// whether or not the archive switch is on: they correct today's standing, not a history.
