// spellUpgradePlan.ts — WHERE SHOULD MY NEXT MOTES GO
// (docs/plans/spell-upgrades-and-loadout.md §4.2).
//
// ============================================================================
// THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS, AND WHY IT IS A REAL ONE
// ============================================================================
// Motes DOUBLE per tier: `2^(t-1)` to reach tier t, `2^t - 1` spent to stand there. Tier 10 alone
// costs 512 of a line's 1,023 total. So "which spell" is not a matter of taste - the last rung of
// one ladder costs more than the first nine of another, and a player who spreads them evenly ends
// up with ten tier-3 spells instead of three tier-6 ones.
//
// This file ranks the answer, and it ranks it ON YOUR OWN LADDER: `observedSpellRanks` is what the
// log has watched this character hold, so a row saying "you are at IV, the next tier costs 16" is a
// statement about him rather than about a hypothetical.
//
// ============================================================================
// THREE PANELS, ONE FOLD
// ============================================================================
//   `next`      - every line you hold, ranked by VALUE PER MOTE for its next tier.
//   `deadEnds`  - the lines whose numbers never move at any tier. The fork user's own report:
//                 *"some spells upgraded don't give a benefit beyond reduced mana cost and cast
//                 time like Bear Form"*. Not hidden behind a filter - it is the answer to a question
//                 he asked out loud, so it is a panel.
//   `unranked`  - lines you hold that could not be valued at all, counted rather than dropped.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT "VALUE" MEANS HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT roleWeights
// ============================================================================
// The Loadout tab scores a BUFF through `planner/roleWeights.ts`, because what a stat is worth
// depends on how you play. This tab is about the spells you CAST, and their value is the figure
// they already state: a nuke's damage, a heal's healing. So `valueOf` below is deliberately narrow
// and deliberately explicit - a percentage OF THE SPELL'S OWN BASE, not a cross-spell comparison.
//
// THAT MATTERS, AND IT IS THE ONE SUBTLETY IN THE FILE. Ranking on raw gained damage would put
// every high-level nuke above every low-level one for the trivial reason that it hits harder, and
// tell a level-50 wizard to pour motes into the biggest spell he owns regardless of how little a
// tier adds. Ranking on the FRACTION gained per mote answers the question actually being asked:
// where does the next mote buy the most improvement.
//
// Pure: no React, no Electron, no clock. Relative value imports, the shared/ house rule.
