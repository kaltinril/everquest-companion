// One line per module with a merge rule. A module without a line shows the live log only, as it
// always has; a segment still stores its snapshot, so the day its line lands it applies to logs
// archived earlier too (phase 4).

 * The first usable state starts the fold as itself, not as its join with the empty template: the
 * template is a shape test, not a side. Joined through it, a rule that reads the newer side's present
 * read an empty one: respawn dropped every archived clock (the template watches nothing), and
 * progression counted the live side's `dropped` twice. Found and fixed with step 3.8.
