// ============================================================================
// shared/factionLog.ts — the LOG's faction receipt lines, and the fold that turns them into a
// correction on a stale `/outputfile faction` dump. PURE (no fs, no Electron), both tsconfigs.
// ============================================================================
//
// THE LINES, MEASURED (Drywrought's real log, 2026-09-05 — 21,354 faction lines, every one
// accounted for by exactly two shapes; the classic "got better"/"got worse" wording occurs ZERO
// times on Legends):
//
//   Your faction standing with Heretics has been adjusted by -5.
//   Your faction standing with Ring of Scale could not possibly get any better.
//   Your faction standing with Agents of Mistmoore could not possibly get any worse.
//
// The first is an EXACT signed delta; the caps are ABSOLUTE pins — the value IS the cap at that
// instant, whatever any older file said. Together they make a stale dump correctable: standing
// now = the dump's number plus every adjustment logged after the dump was written, clamped —
// and after a cap line, the dump stops mattering at all for that faction.
//
// THE FOLD IS COMPRESSED, NOT A REPLAY. A maxed faction prints its cap line on every kill
// (2,387 repeats of one line in the measured log), so per faction only three facts survive:
// the LAST cap seen (everything before it is superseded — the pin restarts the arithmetic),
// the SUM of adjustments after that pin (or after the dump when nothing pinned), and how many
// lines said so. `applyEvidence` turns those into a value; the split exists so the fs half
// (main/factionsEvidence.ts) stays a dozen lines and everything with rules in it is testable
// without a disk.
//
// AND THE PIN SURVIVES A SHORT WINDOW. The reader can only afford the log's tail, so the window
// may not reach back to an old dump — an unpinned faction's sum is then incomplete and is
// reported as such — but a faction whose LAST line in the window is a cap is exact from that
// instant regardless of everything unread before it. That is the property the user asked for by
// name: the cap messages are what update a stale old file.
