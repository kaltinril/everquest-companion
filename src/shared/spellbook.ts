// spellbook.ts — THE CORPUS BROWSER'S ROWS (docs/plans/spell-upgrades-and-loadout.md §4.1).
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT THIS ANSWERS THAT NOTHING ELSE DOES
// ============================================================================
// The owner's ask, verbatim (2026-09-10): *"allow spells to be looked at, because right now spells
// and exaltations don't really tell me WHAT it does, it just says the name of the spell which isn't
// helpful on how much stats or what it does."*
//
// Three surfaces already draw spells and none of them answers that:
//
//   THE BUFFS TAB draws what is on you right now, observed off the log. It knows a buff is up and
//   nothing whatever about what it grants.
//   THE LEVELING TAB'S BEST-SPELLS READOUT ranks what you OWN by efficiency at your level. It is
//   the right answer to "what should I cast" and it deliberately cannot browse: its corpus is your
//   loadout's slice, its figures are damage and healing, and its own header records that at the
//   app's 260px floor it has no room for a fifth column.
//   THE SPELL PAGE answers in full, for ONE spell you already knew to look up.
//
// This is the missing one: the whole catalog, filterable, with what a spell GRANTS and what a mote
// tier BUYS beside every row. It does not rank and it does not recommend - those are the Upgrades
// and Loadout tabs. It is a corpus, and its job is to make a spell findable and legible.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY IT LIVES IN shared/ AND NOT IN THE VIEW
// ============================================================================
// Ruling 4 (eslint.domainMunging.mjs): the renderer never filters or sorts domain collections. The
// sanctioned shape is a PURE FOLD in `src/shared` that the view calls once - which is exactly what
// `bestSpellsSearch.ts` is and why this file is its neighbour rather than a hook. Nothing below
// touches React, and `tests/spellbook.test.mts` drives it over the committed corpus with no app.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE CORPUS IS THE UNLOCK FOLD'S, DELIBERATELY
// ============================================================================
// `LevelUnlockData.spells` is every spell the DB places for at least one class at a stated level -
// ~1,900 rows - already carrying the era verdict, the class levels, the metrics, and (since this
// ticket) the parsed grants and the upgrade category. Re-deriving any of that here would be a
// second opinion about a join main already made, and `bestSpells.ts` made the same choice for the
// same reason. The cost is stated rather than hidden: a spell NO class gains at a stated level is
// not in this corpus and cannot be browsed here. That is 430 rows of NPC-only and unlearnable
// spells (shared/spellLevels.ts measured them), and a browser for spells nobody can cast is not
// what was asked for.
