// progressionTypes.ts — the TRANSPORT half of the leveling-analytics surface: the columnar
// snapshot the `progression` module folds (src/main/modules/progression.ts) and the delta it
// pushes over the generic module channel.
//
// Split out of types.ts for the same reason alertTypes.ts was: that file sits right at the
// MEASURED 400-code-line factoring ceiling and this section pushed it over (429). The section
// text is UNCHANGED and every name here is still exported from `shared/types`, which re-exports
// it explicitly — so no importer moved and no import path changed. The QUERY over these shapes
// lives in shared/progressionStats.ts.

// ----- Leveling analytics: the `progression` module (docs/plans/leveling-analytics.md) -----
//
// A range-queryable time series of everything that moves the level bar: experience samples,
// CREDITED kills (yours + a bound pet — third-party kills are kept separately and never enter
// a rate), loot as an activity signal, and the zone timeline the whole thing is attributed to.
// Deliberately NOT part of LevelingSnap: that snapshot's contract is "everything, forever"
// (the AA identity needs the whole history), while this one is CAPPED drop-oldest — mixing a
// ring into an uncapped snapshot is a semantic trap. `src/main/modules/progression.ts` owns it;
// `src/shared/progressionStats.ts` is the pure query over it.

/**
 * ONE credited kill, named. The columnar series above deliberately carries no names (a name
 * column would be ~40k strings against a numeric budget), so this is a small bounded RING —
 * the last `RECENT_KILL_CAP` credited kills, drop-oldest — that rides alongside it purely so a
 * glance surface can say WHAT you killed and what it paid.
 *
 * It is a DUPLICATE VIEW of `killTs`/`killCredit`, never a second source of truth: no statistic
 * is derived from it, its drops never enter `dropped`/`windowStart` (those describe the capped
 * COLUMNS' retention floor, and a 50-row ring drops constantly), and losing it entirely would
 * change no number anywhere.
