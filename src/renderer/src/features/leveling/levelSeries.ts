// Level-series derivation for the leveling view (Task: honest "Level over time").
//
// WORLD MODEL (verified against the real log, Aug 2 2026):
//   • The ONLY level line family is `You have gained a level! Welcome to level N!`
//     (src/main/log/parser.ts LEVEL_RE). There is NO loadout-swap / class-change line —
//     every "loadout"/"swap" string in the log is another player's chat.
//   • EQ Legends gives a character ONE level shared by a THREE-class loadout, not three
//     concurrent levels: the self `/who` line reads `[50 PAL/MNK/ENC] Primitive (Dark Elf)`
//     — one number, three classes. Swapping a class into the loadout drops that single
//     level back to the new class's (level 10).
//   • Those `/who` lines are user-typed and sparse (11 in 985k lines, none anywhere near
//     the observed swap), so the ACTIVE CLASS TRIO IS NOT DERIVABLE at a level-up. We
//     therefore model one honest series and label the discontinuities, rather than
//     inventing per-class lines the log cannot support (world-model law #1/#6).
//
// The consequence for display: the series legitimately goes DOWN, and the drop itself is
// NEVER logged — we only ever see the first ding of the new loadout (…50, then 11). So:
//   • "current level" is the LATEST reported level, never max() (max is the pre-swap peak).
//   • the chart is drawn as disjoint step segments; nothing is interpolated across a swap.
//   • the elapsed time between the last pre-swap ding and the first post-swap ding is NOT
//     "how long that level took" — it spans the unobserved swap — so it is suppressed.
