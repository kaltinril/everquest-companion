// gear/gearFilter.ts — THE GEAR TABLE'S MODEL: scale, then filter, then sort (JOS-284, phase 3).
//
// THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE DESIGN, and it is not negotiable. The global plus-state selector changes
// what every row IS — a weapon's ratio improves with every tier because DMG scales and DELAY does
// not (phase 0's rule, `gearScale.ts`'s header) — so a sort that ran on BASE numbers under a `+5`
// slider would be answering a question nobody asked. Everything below reads the SCALED vector:
//
//     scaleAll(rows, state) → filterGearRows(…) → sortGearRows(…)
//
// `scaleAll` is measured at ~18 ms for the whole 6,814-row index (tests/gearIndex.test.mts prints
// it every run), which is what lets the selector be a live slider rather than an Apply button.
//
// PURE AND NODE-TESTABLE (`tests/gearFilter.test.mts`), the plannerGroups/plannerClasses precedent:
// value imports are RELATIVE, nothing here touches React, storage, IPC or the corpus. The one rule
// this file does NOT own is the ERA verdict — that lives in `plannerData.eraHides`, which reaches
// the renderer's mob-catalog inversion and cannot be imported under the node runner. So it arrives
// as an injected predicate (`GearFilterDeps.eraHidden`) rather than being restated here, which is
// also what keeps the gear table and the exaltation browser from ever disagreeing about an era.
//
// ABSENT IS NOT ZERO, AND THE SORT IS WHERE THAT NOW LIVES. `GearStats` omits a key the item never
// stated (gear.ts, law 1), so a SORT puts absent LAST in both directions — ascending by haste must
// not rank six thousand plain items above the sixty-four that state one, and descending must not
// either. `gearRatio` is `undefined` for anything that is not a weapon, so a ratio sort never ranks
// 5,000 non-weapons at zero. `gearEffectiveHp` (JOS-336) obeys the same rule from the other side: a
// row stating NEITHER HP nor STA reads `undefined`, while a row stating just one reads that one —
// silence is not a zero, and a stated number is not silence.
//
// THE NUMERIC FILTER LEFT THIS FILE ONCE AND CAME BACK BY A DIFFERENT DOOR. JOS-302 (owner ruling
// 2026-08-13, fourth ask: *drop the min-ratio and stat-at-least filters completely - sorting
// services that need without spending toolbar real estate*) deleted the toolbar's stat-threshold
// chips and `minRatio` box outright. On 2026-08-15 kaltinril (the fork) asked to be able to FILTER BY ANY
// COLUMN, which partially overrules that — and the shape of the return honours what the ruling was
// actually about, which was TOOLBAR REAL ESTATE: thresholds now ride the search box as tokens
// (`ac>=20`, `str>5`, `ratio>=1`, `bis>40` — `parseGearQuery` below), so they cost no toolbar
// control at all. They read the SCALED vector through `sortValue`, the same derivation every cell
// and every sort reads, so "ratio>=1 at +5" means at +5. A word that is not a threshold token is
// search text exactly as before, and the two compose in one box. The threshold's OLD other job —
// conjuring the stat's column — stays with the columns picker (JOS-297, gearColumns.ts).
//
// THE STRUCTURED FILTERS ARE STILL CLOSED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO A ROW IS — its name, its slots, its
// weapon kind, its classes, its effect kind, and (2026-08-15) whether it reads as a shield — plus
// the two injected verdicts (era, ownership). Every one of them is a set membership rather than a
// number; the numbers live in the search text.
