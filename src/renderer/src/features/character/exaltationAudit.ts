// character/exaltationAudit.ts — THE EXALTATION CLEANUP ADVISOR (fork ask, kaltinril 2026-09-09:
// "if I have Burning Affliction I and II, it should tell me to get rid of I. If I have 2 of the
// same, tell me to get rid of one" - and the items are class-specific).
//
// PURE AND NODE-TESTED (tests/exaltationAudit.test.mts), the slotSockets.ts posture: relative
// value imports, no React, no IPC. It WRITES nothing and destroys nothing - every line it
// produces is advice over two things the app already holds, the inventory dump's own
// `(Exaltation)` rows and the committed gear index's effect table. The player does the deciding.
//
// TWO KINDS OF FINDING, EACH WITH ITS HONESTY CLAUSE:
//
//   DUPLICATES - more copies of one exaltation than the dump shows socketed. Reported as counts,
//   never as "get rid of it": a loose second copy may be waiting for the offhand (the user's own
//   Blood Fire pair is exactly that), so the row states copies / socketed / loose and stops.
//
//   SUPERSEDED TIERS - a ranked effect (Burning Affliction I) owned while a higher tier of the
//   SAME family (Burning Affliction III) is also owned on a donor the character's classes can
//   use. The class gate runs on the BETTER copy: an unusable higher tier supersedes nothing,
//   which is the "items are class-specific" half of the ask. Rank comes from the corpus's own
//   focus parse (`GearEffect.family`/`familyTier`) with a roman-numeral fallback for the effect
//   kinds that parse never covered - the fallback reads only a trailing I..X off the effect name,
//   the exact spelling the wiki uses for every ranked line.
