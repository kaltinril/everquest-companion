// character/CharacterView — the Magelo-style character sheet (JOS-45), released in JOS-327.
//
// Identity across the top, the armory slot grid on the left, what the gear adds up to on the
// right, and — since JOS-327 — the whole rest of the dump underneath: every bag slot, every bank
// slot, every key ring, searchable. Everything on this tab comes from two places and says which:
// the log (name, level, class loadout) and the newest `/outputfile inventory` dump.
//
// IT WAS UNRELEASED, AND THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE LAW IT LIVED UNDER, KEPT ON PURPOSE. From JOS-45
// (owner, 2026-08-06) this whole tree sat behind the compile-time `UNRELEASED` flag: reachable in
// a dev build, STRIPPED from every packaged build, pending the owner's review — and it was stated
// that it would graduate by DELETING its gate rather than by flipping a setting. That is exactly
// what happened on 2026-08-13: `unreleasedCharacter.tsx` deleted, the `KNOWN_VIEWS` splice made
// unconditional, the main-side handler registered like any other. The flag machinery survives with
// no tenant (src/renderer/src/devFlags.ts, src/main/unreleased.ts) because the arrangement is worth
// more than this one use of it. Nothing about the gate is left in this file but its history.
//
// WHAT THIS TAB DOES NOT SHOW, AND WHY THERE IS NO PANEL APOLOGISING FOR IT: your real AC, HP,
// mana, resists and AA. The JOS-45 spike read the shipped client's own string table — no
// `/outputfile` variant exports character stats, and no AA export exists at all. So there is no
// empty "AA" card here to explain a permanent absence; the sheet shows what can be known and
// the gear panel names its own scope in its heading.
//
// AND THE TOTALS READ EACH ITEM AT ITS ` +N` (owner ruling, JOS-416, 2026-08-19 — reversing
// JOS-327's "keep character totals base initially"). The gear panel used to sum the item pages'
// BASE blocks while the rest of the app — the Gear tab's comparison, the wish list, every hover
// delta — already scaled the same worn item by the same suffix, so this tab was the one surface
// answering a different number for the same cloak. It now goes through `shared/itemUpgrade.ts
// scaleStatBlock`, the same algorithm, for EVERY stat that algorithm scales; the caption that used
// to say `base` says `with +N`, so the panel's meaning moved on purpose and out loud rather than
// silently. The per-item ` +N` is still visible where the dump spelled it, on the item's own name
// in the slot grid and in the carry-all ledger.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE LAYOUT: A SHEET ON TOP, A LEDGER UNDERNEATH, AND A MEASURED REASON THE PAGE SCROLLS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MEASURED at the default window (1280x860, windowState.ts) when JOS-327 shipped: identity +
// freshness line + the slot grid + the gear panel came to about 656px of the ~740px content area,
// and the cells have only GROWN since — each worn ` +N` item now carries a socket line, and a cell
// with wishes placed at its slot carries a chip row under that (owner ask 2026-08-23, SlotGrid.tsx).
// The exact pixel count is not the law and is not re-measured; what holds is the shape. The sheet
// is not a growing list — it is twenty-four cells, taller or shorter by what is WORN, never by
// what is carried — so a ledger sharing the remaining height with `flexGrow` alone got EIGHTY-FIVE
// PIXELS, which is one row and a scrollbar. That is a worse surface than the one this ticket set
// out to build, so this tab is a naturally tall page: the root asks for `minHeight: 100%` rather
// than `height: 100%`, and `CarryAll` takes a FLOOR (`minHeight`) plus `flexGrow`, so it fills a
// tall window and still gets a usable box on a short one. The app shell scrolls the difference,
// and the height-identity step in `tests/e2e/character-sheet.e2e.mts` is what pins the rest.
//
// THE GROWING-LIST LAW IS KEPT, AND KEPT WHERE IT MATTERS. What that law protects against is a page
// whose height is a function of the DATA — an append-only panel that squeezes its siblings to 0px
// as it fills. Nothing here does: the ledger is windowed inside its own `overflow: auto` box at a
// height that does not know how many rows exist, so a character with thirty things and a character
// with three hundred produce a page of exactly the same height. `tests/e2e/character-sheet.e2e.mts`
// asserts that identity directly (search the ledger down to four rows; the page must not move) and
// separately asserts that the WINDOW itself never scrolls, which is the half of the law that has no
// carve-outs anywhere.
