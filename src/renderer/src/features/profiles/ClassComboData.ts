// ClassComboData — the renderer's one subscription to the class-combo module, and the delta
// merge that keeps it honest.
//
// THE MERGE IS BY ID AND THE `removed` LIST IS LOAD-BEARING. A correction recomputes every
// interval from the retained observation ring, so ids are NOT stable across a recompute
// (docs/plans/class-combo-inference.md §5.4): an interval that split into two vanishes and two
// new ones arrive. A merge that only upserted `changed` would leave the ghost on screen forever.
// Nothing here ever persists an id — the write path keys on TIME for exactly this reason.
