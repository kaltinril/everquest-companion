// maps/MapZoneAdvice — "where should I be", for one level and one reason, as a table.
//
// Owner asks (kaltinril 2026-09-11, -12): *"somewhere it shows recommendation for where to level,
// where to get motes"*, then *"different level ranges for different stuff - D4 mote farming, or
// best EXP or best gear, or most wishlist items in a single zone"*, then, of the first table:
// *"this is a horrible gridview ... need filters/search/sort"*.
//
// `shared/zoneAdvice.ts` carries the three rankings, the measurements behind them, and why "best
// gear" is not one of them yet. This file owns the state and composes two neighbours in the Gear
// tab's arrangement: `MapZoneAdviceBar` (level, goal, search, fit filter) over
// `MapZoneAdviceTable` (sortable heads, windowed fixed-height rows).
//
// ── NOTHING IS FILTERED OR SORTED HERE (ruling 4) ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The bar's search and fit chips go INTO `rankZones` as options and the header's sort goes into
// `sortAdvice`; this file asks for the rows it wants and windows what comes back. That is the
// same seam `GearView` keeps with `filterGearRows` / `sortGearRows`, and it is what lets the
// ranking be tested without a renderer.
//
// ── THE RIGHT-HAND COLUMN IS THE GOAL'S, AND SOMETIMES THERE ISN'T ONE ───────────────────────
//
// The first version printed the mote rate on every row, and the owner's screenshot showed why
// that was noise: at one level every listed zone cons the same and every row said 8.5. So the
// column is the goal's own driver - the rate for experience (where green's 3.1 against 8.5 is
// the whole point), the wished-item count for the wish list - and the mote goal has NO extra
// number, because its driver is the fit chip and the band already on the row.
