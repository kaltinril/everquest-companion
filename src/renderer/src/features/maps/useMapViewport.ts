// The map viewer's ZOOM/PAN interaction (docs/plans/map-viewer.md §6.2) — the 2-D sibling of
// `features/combat/useTimelineViewport.ts`, and deliberately the same shape:
//
//   - Mouse WHEEL over the surface zooms around the CURSOR (anchored zoom, both axes).
//   - Drag pans, against the window captured at drag START (no accumulation, no drift).
//   - `fit()` resets to the whole zone; the view STARTS fit and re-fits when the zone changes.
//   - A ResizeObserver measures the host, and the pure `mapGeometry` module does all the maths.
//
// TWO DETAILS THAT COST AN HOUR EACH IF MISSED:
//
//   1. The wheel listener is attached NATIVELY and NON-PASSIVELY. React's `onWheel` is passive,
//      so `preventDefault()` there is a no-op (and warns) and the pane scrolls instead of
//      zooming. Same trap, same fix, as useTimelineViewport.ts:116-124.
//   2. `view` is null while the map is FITTED, and the fit is recomputed from the live pane
//      size. A concrete "fitted" view would go stale the moment the window is resized, and the
//      map would sit off-centre until the user touched it.
//
// State is the view; every projection is derived. No rAF loop: a wheel or a pointermove sets
// state, React re-renders, and MapCanvas redraws in its effect. An idle map costs nothing.
//
// HOW THE THREE PIECES COMPOSE (the containing view owns the host box and the layer toggles):
//
//   const hostRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
//   const vp = useMapViewport({ bounds: data.bounds, id: data.zone, hostRef })
//   <Box ref={hostRef} onPointerDown={vp.onPointerDown} onPointerMove={vp.onPointerMove}
//        onPointerUp={vp.onPointerUp}
//        sx={{ position:'relative', flexGrow:1, minHeight:0, overflow:'hidden',
//              touchAction:'none', cursor: vp.dragging ? 'grabbing' : 'grab' }}>
//     <MapCanvas lines={data.lines} vp={vp} layers={layers} zBand={zBand} />
//     <MapPointsLayer points={data.points} vp={vp} layers={layers} bands={bands} floor={floor} />
//   </Box>
//
// `layers` starts as mapGeometry.DEFAULT_LAYERS (the legend off). `bands`/`floor` are the floor
// slice (floorSlice.ts) and default to "All levels". `vp.centerOn(x, y)` is the search's
// jump-to-a-hit; `MapPointsLayer.labelPosition(vp, point)` is where that hit's marker goes, so
// the marker and the label can never disagree.
//
// THE REDRAW CADENCE IS ALSO THE LAYOUT CADENCE. Nothing here runs per frame: a wheel or a
// pointermove sets state once, React re-renders, the canvas repaints in its effect and the label
// declutter re-runs in its memo. That is why a screen-space collision pass over 320 labels is
// affordable — it happens per view CHANGE, not per animation frame.

/**
 * Measure the host box. Fed straight into the pure geometry — no sizing logic lives here.
 *
 * TWO REASONS THIS IS NOT "just a ResizeObserver" (both MEASURED, wave 3):
 *
 *   1. THE HOST DOES NOT EXIST WHEN THE HOOK MOUNTS. The view renders its pane only once a map
 *      has loaded (before that it shows the zone picker), so on the first run `hostRef.current`
 *      is null and there is nothing to observe. An effect keyed only on the ref never re-runs —
 *      the ref's identity is stable by construction — so the observer would never attach at all.
 *      `id` changes exactly when a map lands, which is exactly when the pane appears.
 *   2. A HIDDEN WINDOW NEVER DELIVERS ResizeObserver CALLBACKS. `EQ_E2E=1` runs the app with no
 *      window shown, and Chromium's observer callbacks ride the rendering steps, which a window
 *      that never composites does not run. Measured: with the RO alone the canvas kept its
 *      intrinsic 300×150 default and the map drew nothing at all under the harness.
 *
 * So: read the box SYNCHRONOUSLY in a layout effect (before paint, no blank first frame — the
 * `useWindowedRows.ts` precedent), then observe for the resizes that follow.
