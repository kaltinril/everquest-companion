// planner/EffectFilterBar.tsx — the Effects browser's one toolbar row.
//
// Split out of `EffectBrowser.tsx` when the non-equippable toggle pushed that file past the
// measured 400-code-line ceiling (2026-08-04), and this is the seam the ceiling was pointing at:
// the browser is a windowed LIST, the bar is a set of independent CONTROLS, and they share nothing
// but the filter object they read and write. No behaviour changed in the move.
//
// ONE NOWRAP ROW (the flexWrap law): every control keeps its size and the search box is the only
// thing allowed to shrink — a bar that wraps turns a toolbar into a growing block and pushes the
// list it filters off the bottom of the pane.
//
// FIVE CONTROLS, TWO KINDS. Socket type / search / slot are this mount's own state; "Usable by
// these classes" reads the browse's class filter (JOS-326: it used to read the selected SET's
// trio, and the sets' switcher is gone — the filter itself is not). "Current era",
// "Non-equippable" and "Group by" are the PERSISTED set (`eq.planner.*`), handed in as their
// `useState`-shaped tuples so this file owns none of that storage — see plannerData for what each
// one means and why the two toggles' defaults are opposites.
//
// …AND ONE LEADING CHIP THAT NAMES THE ITEM (JOS-210). It is one control in two states: nothing
// picked, so it offers to pick; or an item picked, so it says which and can be cleared. The SOCKET
// TABS do not clear it, because "show me this item's worn effects instead of its procs" is one
// question, not two (the bug half of JOS-210: every filter-bar write used to hand the browser back).
//
// GROUP BY offers only the axes its socket tab can serve (`plannerGroups.axesFor` — "Focus family"
// exists on the Focus tab and nowhere else), so the control can never ask for a fold the model
// would answer with one header.
//
// AND NO POPPER (JOS-143). The three toggle chips sit immediately right of the Slot and Group by
// selects on a NOWRAP row, and their hints are sentences — a popper is centred on its anchor, so a
// card wide enough to hold "Hide donors from outside <era>" reaches back across the select beside
// it and, being interactive by default, eats the click aimed at that select. The hints are native
// `title`s now: same words, no DOM node, no hit area.

 *
 * IT USED TO HAVE A THIRD STATE (JOS-326 removed it). While the Inventory tab existed, an item
 * could also arrive as a `BrowsePreset` — one socket of one host — and the chip then named the CELL
 * and the SOCKET too, because the tabs and the slot select beside it were showing values the user
 * had not chosen. There are no cells any more, so every narrowing on this bar is one the user made
