// slayer/slayerAreas.ts — WHERE ON THE MAP the picked counters' mobs stand. Pure: no React.
//
// The Maps tab pins a mob where its wiki page says it spawns. For someone working on Slayer
// counters the useful unit is coarser than a pin: "the corner of this zone with the scarecrows and
// the bats in it". So the spawn points of every mob that counts toward a PICKED counter are
// grouped into areas, and each area says which achievements it serves.
//
// HOW POINTS BECOME AREAS. Two spawn points closer than `LINK` map units are one area, and so is
// anything chained to them (single linkage). An area is drawn as the circle around its points'
// centre that holds them all, padded, and never smaller than `MIN_RADIUS`, so a lone spawn point
// is still a place you can see. The numbers are map units, the same ones `/loc` prints.
//
// WHAT IS NOT DRAWN, for the reason the pin layer gives (mobPins.ts): a mob whose page names
// several zones states locations nobody can assign to the map on screen, and a mob whose page
// states none has nowhere to be drawn. Both still count in the Achievements tab's zone list.
// A mob above the plan's level cap is left out here as the zone list leaves it out
// (`keptMob`: the level cap, and the faction switch), so the list and the map never disagree about
// where to go.
