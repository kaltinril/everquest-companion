// loot/itemUpgradeSim.ts — the item card's simulate-upgrade slider, as a PURE MODEL.
//
// The Loot drill-down draws a wearable item at any plus-state with the Gear toolbar's own control
// (fork decision, kaltinril 2026-09-13). The component (ItemDetailDialog.tsx `ItemWindowColumn`)
// owns one `useState`; every decision around it is here, where a node test can reach it:
//
//   * WHICH ITEMS get the control — the ones that state a `Slot:` line. That is the same census the
//     Gear tab's index takes (shared/planner/gear.ts: a row exists when it has a slot); an item
//     with no slot is not worn and has nothing to simulate.
//   * WHERE THE SLIDER OPENS — the tier the displayed name states, else base. `upgradeStateForTier`
//     is the one reading of a ` +N` the app has (a name says the tier and stops), so a ` +3` loot
//     line opens at tier 3 with the wiki's base numbers scaled to it.
//   * WHEN THE WINDOW IS TOLD — the stats are the wiki's base block, so the window is handed the
//     seed itself when the name puts it past base, and its meter reads the name's tier as always.
//     Only once the reader has moved off the seed is it a `simulated` state; at a base seed the
//     window is handed nothing (the name, or your own merge history with its `yours` tag).
//
// Nothing here scales a number: that is `scaleStatBlock` (shared/itemUpgrade.ts), called by the
// window itself.
