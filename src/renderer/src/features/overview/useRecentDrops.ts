// WHY THE LOOT MODULE AND NOT THE EVENT FEED (docs/plans/overview-tab.md §3.4). The event-log
// OVERLAY's loot rows are LIVE-ONLY by design (its module returns early when `live` is false), so
// opening it never spams hours of replayed history. Overview is the opposite case: it is a
// landing surface you open AFTER the app has read your log, and a feed that stays empty until
// something happens next would be a blank card. So this reads the `loot` module — whose snapshot
// IS the full history — and renders the newest `DROP_FEED_CAP` rows. A *recent drops* list, not
// a live event stream. Both are honest; neither duplicates the other's state.
//
// Knowledge comes from `useNotablePickups`, the SAME hook the Loot tab uses, so the two surfaces
// can never disagree about what is notable. It probes the most-recent 40 DISTINCT items, which
// strictly contains the 25 rows rendered here.
