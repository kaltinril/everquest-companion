// useRecentKills — the `progression` module's named kill ring → the Overview feed's rows.
//
// WHY THE PROGRESSION MODULE AND NOT THE KILLS MODULE. The progression series is the one place
// a kill is joined to the experience it paid (the join is measured and lives in
// src/main/modules/progression.ts: the experience line PRECEDES its kill line, always, so the
// module pairs them at fold time). Nothing renderer-side could reconstruct that pairing from two
// separate module snapshots without re-deriving the whole rule, and a second implementation of a
// measured rule is exactly how two surfaces start disagreeing.
//
// A SECOND SUBSCRIBER, deliberately. `useOverviewLeveling` already subscribes to `progression`
// in this same view, so this is a second `useModule` on one module id — the one place in the app
// where that happens. It costs one extra hydration fetch and one extra run of the (pure) delta
// reducer per flush, over a snapshot three orders of magnitude under its caps. The alternative —
// widening `OverviewLevelingState` to carry a feed the leveling CARD does not render — would put
// two unrelated cards' data behind one derivation, which is the coupling the Overview tab's whole
// "each card owns its own hook" rule exists to prevent.
//
// NOT GATED ON HYDRATION, exactly like the recent-drops feed: kills are HISTORY. The module's
// ring is complete and correct during the startup replay, so a spinner over a list of real past
// kills would be a lie in the other direction.
