// posky/turnInActions.ts — the three things a user can SAY about the turn-in ledger.
//
// Split out of `useProgress.ts` when upstream issue #72 added the third one (the reset) and the
// file crossed its 400-line ceiling. The seam is the honest one: `useTurnInLedger` DERIVES the
// ledger (the log's detections merged with the store, minus what was taken back), and this module
// is the statements that change it. Every statement is arithmetic in shared/questTurnIns.ts
// (`takeBackTurnIn`, `rejectAllTurnIns`) and one IPC; nothing here decides what a count means.
