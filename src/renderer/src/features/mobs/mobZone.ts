// mobZone.ts — "what lives WHERE I AM" (Task #64 browse rework).
//
// The Mobs tab's default surface answers the question you actually have when you open it while
// playing: not "what have I conned most" but "what is in this zone". That is a JOIN between one
// dirty string (the zone the log last printed) and 7,866 catalog rows whose `zones` come off the
// wiki — two independent naming authorities that agree most of the time and disagree in exactly
// three mechanical ways. This module is that join, and nothing else.
//
// THE FOLD, and why each rule exists (every one MEASURED against the real log + the committed
// catalog, 2026-08-03 — see the evidence beside each rule):
//
//   1. INSTANCE NOISE. EQ Legends encodes instance difficulty in the zone name. The main-side
//      source of truth is `zoneTier()` in `src/main/log/parseWorld.ts` (AGENTS.md, "Log-format
//      quick reference"): a trailing `(Awakened|Adaptive|Fused|Refined)` is d1–d4, and
//      `- Solo` / `- Group N` is further noise. Real log shapes, verbatim:
//        "Najena 4 (Refined)", "The Plane of Sky 1 (Awakened)",
//        "The Ruins of Old Paineel - Solo 4 (Refined)", "The Plane of Hate - Solo".
//      The catalog never carries any of it, so an un-stripped zone matches ZERO rows — the
//      instance of a zone has the same bestiary as the zone.
//      We RE-IMPLEMENT the three strips here rather than import them: this file is renderer-side
//      and node-testable (see mobSearch.ts:33 for the same reasoning about value imports), and
//      main's copy carries a tier NUMBER we have no use for. If the game adds a tier adjective,
//      the paren strip is shape-based and already covers it; parseWorld's TIER_ADJ table is the
//      one that would need teaching.
//
//   2. THE LEADING ARTICLE. The log says "The Oasis of Marr"; the catalog says "Oasis of Marr".
//      Folding it is load-bearing, not cosmetic — it is the difference between 0 and N rows for
//      "The Northern Desert of Ro" (25), "The Plane of Sky" (65), "The Rathe Mountains" (104),
//      "The Ocean of Tears" (76), "The Lavastorm Mountains" (31), "The Temple of Solusek Ro"
//      (28) and more. The catalog is not consistent WITH ITSELF either ("The Feerrott" 40 rows,
//      "Feerrott" 1), so the fold has to run on BOTH sides. Same rule as world-model law 2's
//      "strip leading a/an/the for boss matching".
//
//   3. SEPARATOR PUNCTUATION. Both sides spell the same zone with and without a hyphen:
//      log "Neriak - Commons" vs catalog "Neriak Commons" (88 rows), and inside the catalog
//      "Cazic Thule" vs "Cazic-Thule", "Neriak Foreign Quarter" vs "Neriak - Foreign Quarter".
//      Collapsing runs of whitespace/hyphens to one space merges exactly those pairs — a sweep
//      of all 192 catalog zones under this fold produces NO collision between two zones that
//      are genuinely different places.
//
// THE FOURTH RULE IS NOT A STRING RULE — IT IS KNOWLEDGE. Some zones fold cleanly and still
// miss, because the two sources use a different NAME for the place, not a different spelling:
// log "The Ruins of Old Paineel" is catalog "The Hole" (45 rows), "The City of Guk" is
// "Upper Guk" (51), "The Ruins of Old Guk" is "Lower Guk" (63), plus Permafrost, Splitpaw and
// the Karana/Ro/Commonlands abbreviation families. That table now EXISTS — `src/shared/zones.ts`
// (`catalogZonesFor`), where every row was verified by intersecting the mobs the live log
// recorded slain in the zone against the catalog rows carrying the candidate spelling — so this
// join consumes it. It is a UNION with the fold above, never a replacement: `catalogZonesFor`
// returns `[]` both for an unknown zone and for the common case where the fold already suffices.
//
// WHAT IT STILL DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: guess. There is no fuzzy or closest-match zone
// matching here and there must never be one — the catalog carries a genuinely distinct
// "Paineel" (116 rows) AND "The Hole" (45), two real places one letter-distance apart, and a
// nearest-name match would silently serve one zone's bestiary for the other. A zone that is
// neither an exact fold nor a VERIFIED alias shows the empty state (law 1 — never silently
// invent).

import type { MobEntry } from '@shared/types'
// RELATIVE, not `@shared/zones`, and deliberately: this is a VALUE import and the alias only
// exists inside the vite build, while `tests/mobZone.test.mts` drives this module under the node
// test runner. Same constraint, same reasoning as mobSearch.ts:33. (`shared/zones` is pure — its
// own only import is type-only — so nothing follows it into the test process.)
