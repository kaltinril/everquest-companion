// achievements/AchievementsView.tsx — THE ACHIEVEMENTS TAB (UNRELEASED, 2026-09-29).
//
// WHAT THIS TAB IS FOR. The game's Achievements window says what there is to do and how much of
// it is done, one group at a time. This tab reads the same thing out of the `/outputfile
// achievements` dump, for whichever character is active, and adds what the window cannot: a
// search across every group, a requirement that opens into the achievement it names, a mob or a
// zone that opens its page or its map, and for the kill counters the zones where several can be
// worked on together (features/slayer/, which this tab grew out of on 2026-09-28).
//
// A RENDER SHELL: every piece of state and derivation is useAchievementsController.ts's, and the
// three columns take their props pre-bundled.
//
// EVERY COLUMN IS ITS OWN SCROLLER (AGENTS.md UI conventions): the view fills its height and each
// list scrolls in a bounded box rather than growing the page.
