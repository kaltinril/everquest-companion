// factions/factionQuests.ts — faction name → the quests that move it. PURE logic module
// (node-testable, no React/IPC), the gearOwnership.ts arrangement.
//
// THE SOURCE is the committed quest catalog (data/eqlegends/quests.json), whose entries carry the
// faction receipt lines their wiki pages quote (`QuestEntry.factions`, scraped offline from the
// cached corpus — scripts/sources/questPage.ts parseFactionHits). The JOIN KEY is the faction's
// name: the wiki links `[[Kerra Isle]]` and the `/outputfile faction` dump's Name column says
// `Kerra Isle`, so a lowercased name equality is the whole join. Factions the dump tracks but no
// quest page names simply have no work on record; factions quest pages name but the dump does not
// track (Kunark/Velious-era names in a classic dump) are indexed anyway and shown or not by the
// caller.
//
// THE PROJECTION HAPPENS HERE, ONCE (owner ruling 4's shape): quests project into this file's own
// row model as they are indexed, so the view filters and sorts ITS OWN rows, never the catalog's.
//
// ZONE IS A STRING FOR NOW: the app has no zone deep link (appRouting reaches mobs, loot, quests,
// levels — not maps), so the start zone renders as text. The day Maps grows a focus payload, the
// zone here is the string to hand it.
