// BossView — the raid-progression roster: search, filters, and the sectioning toggle. The cards
// and the two section kinds live in BossSections.tsx; this file owns the state above them.
//
// The "Recently considered" strip that used to live here MOVED to the Mobs tab in Task #64.
// It lodged here because this tab already answered the other mob question ("which named things
// have I killed") and a con strip needed a roof; Mobs is its actual module home. This tab is
// about RAID PROGRESSION again — and its cards now route to the same mob page everything else
// does, instead of opening a modal only this tab knew how to open.

 * a raid coordinator opens this tab to run a week, so the week view IS their progression and the

 * selected tab. The mechanism is JOS-90's, for JOS-90's reason - `App`'s `ViewContent` mounts
 * exactly one feature view at a time, so plain `useState` here does not survive leaving the tab,
 * let alone a restart, and a stored key is one promise for both.
