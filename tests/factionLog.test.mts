// THE LOG'S FACTION RECEIPTS (shared/factionLog.ts) — the two measured line shapes, the
// compressed fold, and the stale-dump correction they exist for. The line texts are the real
// log's own shapes (measured 2026-09-05: 21,354 lines, two dialects, zero "got better/worse" on
// Legends); the lines below are synthetic instances of those shapes, per the fixture-scrub law.
