// THE EFFECT BROWSER'S FILTER, AND WHAT IT OWES YOU WHEN IT HIDES EVERYTHING (JOS-67).
//
// `filterDonors` is six rules in a row and two of them are TOGGLES the user did not set: the
// current-era filter is on by default and the no-slot filter is off by default. Either can empty a
// search that was typed perfectly, and until this ticket the pane answered "No effects match these
// filters" and stopped there. A player hit exactly that — the Golem Metal Wand's click was real,
// legal for the shield they wanted it in, and invisible because its page states its slot on a line
// the scrape cannot key, so the row arrived slotless and the default filter dropped it (feedback
// 01KZCGXY8WC6YCD8W44W7EAS5H). The data half is fixed in the curated layer; THIS half is the
// promise that the next one says so out loud.
//
// A FIXTURE, like plannerGroups.test.mts beside it: the numbers here are about the FOLD, and four
// hand-written rows can state "slotless", "out of era" and "both at once" in a way the real corpus
// would never let a test name. The corpus's own slot half is `itemsResearchLayer.test.mts`.
//
// `hiddenByView` reports PER TOGGLE — "turn this one off and you would see N" — rather than one
// total, because the two mean different things (era is "not on this server yet", no-slot is "R2
// says never") and only the per-toggle answer is something a person can act on.
