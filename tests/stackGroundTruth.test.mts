// stackGroundTruth — THE GAME'S OWN VERDICTS, as a regression corpus.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHERE THIS CAME FROM
// ============================================================================
// The owner read the Loadout tab's recommended buff set and did not believe it (2026-09-10):
// *"are you sure all these spells are not going to overlap each-other?"* He was right not to, and
// then he did the thing that settles it - twice, from both directions.
//
// FIRST HE CAST HIS BAR AT HIMSELF. EverQuest names both halves when it refuses a buff:
//
//     Your Dexterity spell did not take hold. (Blocked by Harnessing of Spirit.)
//
// which is 40 distinct pairs the GAME says cannot both stand, with no inference and no model in
// between.
//
// THEN HE CAST THIRTEEN OF THEM ON HIS PET, all of which landed: *"i just finished recasting them
// all on my pet who already had them and none failed"*. That is 78 pairs the game demonstrably
// runs TOGETHER - and it is the half that matters most, because a rule that simply called
// everything a conflict would have scored 40 out of 40 on the first half alone.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT THE TWO HALVES TOGETHER OVERTURNED - TWICE IN ONE EVENING
// ============================================================================
// `checkStackConflict` is a port of EQEmu's `CheckStackConflict`, which walks the slots in LOCKSTEP
// and compares slot i against slot i.
//
//   ROUND ONE. Lockstep appeared to miss nearly every conflict anyone would ask about - Celerity
//   keeps its haste in slot 1 and Spirit Quickening keeps its in slot 4, so the two were never
//   compared - and the pass was replaced with one that matched BY EFFECT wherever it sat. That
//   caught all 40 blocks. It was still wrong.
//
//   ROUND TWO. The pet session proved it wrong within the hour: effect-matching calls
//   `Strength + Infusion of Spirit` and `Dexterity + Infusion of Spirit` conflicts, and the game
//   ran both pairs together. Lockstep was never the problem.
//
// THE DIRECTIVE PASS WAS. `directiveVerdict` looks up the 148/149 stacking commands - the things
// that make one buff refuse another from a different LINE - and it was searching for its target at
// a slot number no row in this client uses that way, so it never fired at all. Harnessing of Spirit
// carries `BLOCK{STR below 67}` and `BLOCK{DEX below 50}`, which is exactly why that one spell
// refuses nine different stat buffs in the log, and the engine could not see it.
//
// With lockstep restored and the directives actually working, the model is exact on both halves:
// 40 of 40 blocks reproduced, 81 of 81 coexisting pairs left alone. `spellStack.ts contestPass` and
// `directiveBites` carry the two halves of that argument.
//
// THE MORAL, WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE IT COST TWO WRONG TURNS: a corpus of things that MUST conflict
// cannot validate a conflict rule on its own. Ask for the pairs that stack in the same breath.
//
// ============================================================================
// IT NEEDS THE CLIENT FILE, AND SKIPS WITHOUT IT
// ============================================================================
// `resistBaseline.test.mts`' arrangement exactly, including the env override. The pairs below are
// game text out of the owner's own log and are committed; `spells_us.txt` is Daybreak's file, is
// never committed, and is read from whatever install the machine running the tests has.
