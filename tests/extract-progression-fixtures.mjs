// Progression / leveling-analytics fixture extractor (docs/plans/leveling-analytics.md §7).
//
// Slices real spans out of the live log and keeps every line the ProgressionModule folds:
// experience, level-ups, AA gains/purchases, zone transitions, both kill-credit shapes, the
// pet-binding lines those depend on, loot (the idle heuristic's activity signal), and the self
// `/who` row (the only line that ever states a class loadout — the ComboSource seam's evidence).
//
// Routed through the SHARED scrub (tests/fixture-scrub.mjs `scrubKeep`) like every other
// extractor: ONE definition of "third-party chat" for the whole tree, and never a hand-copied
// raw span. The scrub's pet-claim carve-out is what keeps `<Name> told you, '… Master.'` — the
// only binding signal for a summoned pet — and its self-`/who` exemption keeps Primitive's own
// row while dropping every stranger's.
//
// TWO DELIBERATE WIDENINGS over the plan's KEEP list, both to stop the fixture from lying:
//   • `gained (?:an|\d+) ability point` — the plan's `\d+` form misses `You have gained AN
//     ability point!`, which the parser's AA_RE accepts (`(an|\d+)`). Dropping those would
//     silently under-count aaGained in a window that exists to prove AA lands at the cap.
//   • `You looted …` (the auto-disposition family: currency / sold / hoard / depot / combine)
//     alongside the dashed `--You have looted …--`. Both are `loot` events, and the idle
//     heuristic counts loot as ACTIVITY — keeping only half the family would manufacture idle
//     gaps the real session never had.
//

// WL40 THE FARM RUN — Sun Aug 02 15:12:00 ("Welcome to level 18!") → 17:33:26 ("… level 28!").
// The core case: TEN dings in 2h21m of dense solo farming, every exp line carrying a
// percentage, plus 5 zone lines (Innothule Swamp → The City of Guk → The Ruins of Old Guk ×3),
// one ~14-minute travel gap, and 3 third-party kills to be excluded from the rates.
slice(987818, 1017315, 'wl40-farm-run.log')

// WL41 MULTI-ZONE — Sat Aug 01 13:38:00 → 14:10:50, three DISTINCT zones with credited kills
// in each (The Plane of Hate - Solo 1 (Awakened) → The Oasis of Marr → The Plane of Hate -
// Solo 2 (Adaptive)), pet kills included. Pins the per-zone rows, the zone attribution of
// kills, and the `Σ zones[].spanMs == durationMs` identity across a real travel hop.
slice(822348, 834348, 'wl41-multizone.log')

// WL42 IDLE GAPS — Mon Aug 03 00:54:58 → 14:31:26. Contains BOTH shapes the idle classifier
// must tell apart: a ~14-minute break (over the 5-minute threshold, well under an hour) and a
// ~12.6-HOUR overnight silence, across a travel run + a long Ruins of Old Paineel session. The
// long gap is also the case that proves idle is attributed to the zone you were standing in.
slice(1100597, 1110597, 'wl42-idle-gap.log')

// WL43 AT THE CAP, NO PERCENTAGE — Fri Jul 31 17:51:24 (the FIRST percent-less exp line in the
// log) → 18:56. The character hit level 50 at 16:19 and does not ding again for 34 h, so the
// game prints no percentage at all: every exp line in this window is percent-less, and an AA
// gain lands inside it. THE REGRESSION THAT MATTERS — nothing may render 0.0% or a fake rate
// here (`expUnstated > 0`, `levelEquiv == 0`, every levels rate `null`).

// ("… level 13!"). The plan's suggested anchor (raw 1020000–1024500) is WRONG: that span is
// Sun Aug 02 19:19–19:33 and contains dings 29→30, i.e. NO level regression at all, so it
// cannot pin a run split. The 50 → 11 drop is the ONLY loadout swap in the post-epoch log and
// its two ends are 303k raw lines apart, so the window has to span them; there is no smaller
// span that contains a regression. It is the largest fixture in the tree by design, and it
// doubles as an independent second read of the at-cap window WL43 isolates.

// WL45 KILL CREDIT — Thu Jul 30 16:28:12 → 16:56:38 in Nagafen's Lair - Solo, the smallest
// span found that carries all THREE credit shapes with the pet bound INSIDE the window: your
// own killing blows, a bound pet's, and other players'/mobs' kills that must be witnessed-only.

// WL46 ONE PLACE, TWO SPELLINGS, AND THE STEP OUT OF THE INSTANCE — Sun Aug 23 13:37:51 →
// 15:20:30 (JOS-454). THE OWNER'S SCREENSHOT, VERBATIM: the exact stretch he dragged a selection
// across, cut to the instant the record stood at when he took it.
//
//   13:37:58          `You have entered The Plane of Hate.` — the open world, 76 seconds of it
//   13:39:14          `You have entered The Plane of Hate 4 (Refined).` — the instance, and the
//                     next 1h35m of real farming: dings, dozens of kills, the lot
//   15:14:55          back into `The Plane of Hate 4 (Refined)` for 27 s
//   15:15:22          `You have entered The Plane of Hate.` — the OPEN WORLD again. Same place,
//                     a different spelling: `zones.zoneKey` folds both to `plane of hate`,
//                     `zoneScope.zoneIdKey` does not.
//   15:16:44          one more plain-Hate zone line, and the record then goes quiet for the rest
//                     of the window. The last interval is left OPEN, which is the second half of
//                     the defect: `zoneSegments` closes an open interval at the END OF THE
//                     RANGE, so an unclamped selection reaching past the record turns the
//                     chart's trailing gutter into time spent standing in that zone.
//
// Under `exactTier` — which is what the exp surfaces OPEN on (JOS-332), and which resolves to
// the tier the log LAST named, i.e. plain `The Plane of Hate` — the numbers are the plain-Hate
// visits and nothing else: no kills, no experience, no active time, while the chart above the
// panel goes on drawing the instance play and its rising curve. That is the whole report.
//
// It is a 1h43m span that survives the KEEP filter as a couple of hundred lines, which is why
// the fixture can be the owner's actual window rather than a miniature of it.
