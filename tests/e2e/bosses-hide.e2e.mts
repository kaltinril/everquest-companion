/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for HIDING RAID TARGETS (GitHub issue #32).
 *
 * THE ASK: "I do not personally see much of a use in displaying all hate minis on the page and
 * even plane of sky could be hideable since it's not effected by the weekly loot as well." The
 * pure half (hidden drops first, the peek, the case armour) is tests/bossHiddenTargets.test.mts;
 * what needs a real app is the SURFACE and the LIFECYCLE:
 *
 *   1. The card's corner control hides WITHOUT routing — the card's own click opens the mob
 *      page, so a hide that also navigated would punish the feature's only gesture. Asserted by
 *      the mode toggle still being mounted after the click.
 *   2. The tally's DENOMINATOR moves with a hide and does NOT move with the peek — hiding is
 *      "this card is not my raid week" (it leaves the count), peeking is looking. Two different
 *      promises, both read off the one toolbar line.
 *   3. The toolbar switch exists ONLY while something is hidden: a fresh install never sees it.
 *   4. THE SET SURVIVES A RESTART and THE PEEK DOES NOT — two launches, one userData dir
 *      through a real process exit. A hide is a standing choice; "show me what I hid" is a
 *      moment.
 *
 * STAGED ON A FIXTURE, unlike bosses-week: a bare `launchApp` leans on a REAL EverQuest install
 * being auto-discoverable, which is true on the owner's machine and false in most other places —
 * on a machine with no install the app (rightly) opens on the no-logs-found onboarding and the
 * Bosses tab never mounts. The roster needs no kills for this spec's subject (a hide is about
 * CARDS, and undefeated cards are still cards), so any committed fixture do — the telemetry
 * one is the smallest.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- bosses-hide` (or node --import tsx this file).
