// GOLDEN-WINDOW ITEM-TIER TESTS — W30–W33 (Task #60): observed item levels.
//
// METHODOLOGY (AGENTS.md): every window is a VERBATIM span of the user's real log, cut by
// tests/extract-item-tier-fixtures.mjs through the shared scrub, hand-read line by line, and
// replayed through the REAL parser + ItemTiersModule. The expectations below are what a
// human counted in the fixture, not what the code produced.
//
//   W30  the merge run (Aug 01 01:40–01:57) — three items levelled at once, with REPEATED
//        tiers (two copies climbing in parallel) and a failed mote merge in the middle.
//   W31  both evidence families in one span (Jul 28 23:40–23:42) — merge lines AND the
//        auto-merge-on-pickup loot line whose `created` names the result.
//   W32  the only four `Your request to merge <A> with <B> failed.` lines in the log — no
//        upgrade happened, but the line states a tier the user is holding.
//   W33  the launch/epoch boundary — the wiped beta character's merges must not survive.
//
// Plus a FULL-LOG tripwire that asserts INVARIANTS only (the log is live and grows; frozen
// counts rot): tier ranges, key canonicalization, the epoch floor on every row, and the
// direction of the contamination the epoch removes.
