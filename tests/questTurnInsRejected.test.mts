// ============================================================================
// Taking a Sky turn-in back (upstream issue #72) — the rejected list.
// ============================================================================
//
// THE REPORT (jmoyers/everquest-companion#72): the Sky tab marked quests turned in that the
// player had not done, and nothing could lower it — not a fresh achievements dump, not the
// Count-from "rebase" (which only moves held counts), not a reinstall (the state is in userData
// and is rebuilt from the log). The mechanism: a trade the log showed can be wrong, an abandoned
// offer folded into the next trade to the same giver, or a trade the NPC handed straight back —
// and a log-detected instant could not be undone, because the next snapshot re-persisted it.
//
// The fix is one rule, pinned here against the REAL shared code: a REJECTED instant
// (`ProgressState.rejectedTurnIns`) is absent everywhere a turn-in is read, and it stays absent
// when the log shows it again. The undo and the reset are both STATEMENTS of that rule
// (`takeBackTurnIn`, `rejectAllTurnIns`), so the renderer carries no arithmetic of its own.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
