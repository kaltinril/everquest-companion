/**
 * PURE mob-page wikitext parser (no network) — the parsing half of `scripts/scrape-mobs.ts`.
 * Sibling of ./questPage.ts, and unit-tested against verbatim wikitext in
 * tests/considerWindows.test.mts.
 *
 * IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT RE-IMPLEMENT THE WIKITEXT READING. `parseMobWikitext` in
 * src/main/mobLookupParse.ts is the SHIPPED definition of "what a mob page says" (it backs the
 * app's live-wiki fallback), and it is electron-free by construction, so the scraper imports it
 * instead of growing a second definition that could drift. What lives here is the scraper's own
 * two concerns:
 *
 *   1. IS THIS A MOB PAGE AT ALL. The enumeration is deliberately over-broad (see
 *      scrape-mobs.ts), and MediaWiki's `embeddedin` reports INDIRECT transclusions — a quest
 *      page that shows a mob box (`{{:A zol ghoul knight}}`) is listed as embedding
 *      Template:Namedmobpage. Only a page whose OWN wikitext opens the template counts.
 *   2. THE COMPACT PROJECTION. The committed catalog is names only (see MobEntry) — no drop
 *      rates, no wikitext — because it is inlined into the main bundle.

/**
 * The page templates that MAKE a page a mob page, verified against the live wiki (2026-08-03):
 *   {{Namedmobpage}}  6,516 pages report embedding it (incl. indirect) — the mob/NPC template,
 *                     carrying |level, |zone, |known_loot, |related_quests.
 *   {{MerchantPage}}  1,361 — a vendor NPC. SAME header fields, but `|items_sold` instead of
 *                     `|known_loot`. Kept in the catalog (a merchant is a thing you can `/con`,
 *                     and its level/zone are real) with NO drops — a vendor's stock is not loot.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY UNANCHORED. The obvious `^\s*\{\{Namedmobpage` is WRONG and was measured to be:
 * most pages open with an ERA tag on the SAME LINE — `{{Classic Era}}{{Namedmobpage`, and also
 * Kunark/Velious/Fear/Hate/Chardok Revamp/Paineel/Temple/Luclin/Epics Era — so a start-of-line
 * anchor rejected 660 of the first 2,145 real mob pages (30%). Matching anywhere is SAFE
 * because the transclusion form a non-mob page carries is `{{:A zol ghoul knight}}` (the colon
 * makes it a page transclusion, not a template call): the indirect-transclusion candidates the
 * enumeration drags in — "Druid Epic Quest" and friends — contain zero occurrences of this
 * literal, verified against the live page.
