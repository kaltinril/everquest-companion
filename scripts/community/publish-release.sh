**EQ Legends Companion TEST $version**, a community build of [EQ Legends Companion](https://github.com/jmoyers/everquest-companion) with the fork's changes on top.

**To install:** download \`$exe\` below and run it. The installer is not code-signed, so Windows shows "Windows protected your PC" the first time: click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. It installs beside the official app, not over it, and keeps its own settings.

**Updates come from this page.** Once installed, the app checks this page every few hours, downloads a newer build quietly, and applies it when you close the app. It never installs the official app over itself, and the official app never replaces it.

\`SHA256SUMS.txt\` holds the installer's checksum, to compare with \`Get-FileHash $exe\`.
